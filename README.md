## About the Project
This project simulates a set of die being rolled an infinite number of times.  The program will calculate the number of times a role of two, seven, and twelve occur.  Afterwards, the program will print out the percentage of times a role of two, seven, and twelve occurred.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* demonstrate understanding of writing function definitions and calling functions within main
* amalgamate the current acquired knowledge of Python, such as input/output, if/elif/else statements, loops, random number generation, and functions into one program
* further practice the basics of Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests an integer value.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer is entered by the user.  

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
